# Crack 2

WIN 64-bit only

## Getting Started

Get Release: https://github.com/kakkoe/Crack2/releases

Back up, then overwrite the existing Assembly-CSharp.dll file found in Rack 2_Data\\Managed with the downloaded one to use it.

## Features
### Customize NPC

A new thing this mod adds is the ability to call up the character customizer for NPCs you are talking to or clients you are interacting with. To do so, just hit ctrl+O.

### Slider

tried to increase the range of most sliders, but most options cannot benefit from this due to how the blendshapes work.

### UI

the climax meter is always visible

you can hold down the left Alt key before interacting with your hand to use your left one instead of the right.

### General

you can use "subjectsize" to do the same to your test subject.

all staff will now be nude (by default, no option)

### Hotkey

 - F5 - Pleasure self
 - F6 - Give handjob to dialogue partner or subject
 - F7 - Give oral to dialogue partner or subject
 - F8 - Ride dialogue partner (wouldn't recommend) or subject
 - F9 - Finger dialogue partner or subject
 - F10 - Fuck dialogue partner (wouldn't recommend) or subject
 - F11 - Make player urinate*
 - F12 - Make dialogue partner or subject urinate*
 - Hyphen - Lower tool mode (i.e. when performing a handjob, switch from polishing to jerking to teasing) (note this does not work on the fly. You have to cancel the animation, change the mode and then reactivate it)
 - Equals - Increase tool mode (reverse of above)
 - Delete - Kill last interaction
 - End - Kill all interactions
 - Left Bracket - Make player orgasm
 - Right Bracket - Make dialogue partner or subject orgasm
 - Forward Slash - Hotkey version of the "clean" console command
 - Insert - Toggle user control over dialogue partner (movement only within loading zone)
 - Home - Toggle user control over player
 - Page Up - Make all characters incrementally horny but not bring to orgasm
 - Page Down - Initiate full flaccidity

You can also change all characters current emotion with 0-3 on the keypad.

the new screenshot key is rebound to "P" so that F12 still works the way Alek's mod originally was configured.

### Fix

#### NPC Cum Fix

Enabling "NPC cum fix" does several things now:
1) makes the stasis tubes non-solid
2) allows cum splats on NPCs (at great cost to performance)
3) calculates IK for all NPCs (again hurts performance)

The "cum life" option in the adjusts the limit of splat spots using a multiplier (<10 is fewer than normal, >10 is exponentially more than normal.)

#### Bug Fix

Fix much large penis and long scrotum trembling or immobilized
